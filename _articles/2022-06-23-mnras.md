Abstract: We investigate the prospects of electromagnetic follow-up observations for binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, with the help of early warnings from decihertz gravitational-wave (GW) observatories, B-DECIGO and DO-Optimal. Extending the previous work, we not only give quick assessments of joint short γ-ray burst (sGRB) detection rates for different γ-ray satellites and BNS population models, but also elaborate on the analyses and results on multi-band kilonova detections for survey telescopes with different limiting magnitudes. During an assumed 4-year mission time for decihertz GW observatories, we find that for the goals of electromagnetic follow-ups, DO-Optimal performs better than B-DECIGO as a whole on the detection rate, and has a larger detectable distance for joint sGRB/kilonova searches. Taking the log-normal population model for BNS mergers and a one-day early-warning time as an example, we discuss the accuracy in localization and timing, as well as the redshift distributions for various synergy observations with electromagnetic facilities and decihertz GW detectors. Based on our analyses, we propose a feasible "wait-for" pattern as a novel detecting mode for future multi-messenger astrophysics.
