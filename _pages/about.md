Welcome to my website! 

I am currently a <a style="color: #CF4C73;"><b>PhD student</b></a> in the [gravitational astrophysics](https://kiaagravity.github.io/about/) group 
of [Lijing Shao](http://friendshao.github.io/about/) at the [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).
My research interests center around <a style="color: #CF4C73;"><b>multi-messenger astronomy</b></a> and <a style="color: #CF4C73;"><b>high-energy astrophysics</b></a>. 
For now, I mainly focus on the gravitational-wave detections and compact stars. 
My [What's more]({{ site.url }}/more/) page could help you to know me more! ^_^ 

I like to talk to other astrophysicists and get to know their works. You can also see my
[publication]({{ site.url }}/publication/) page for a list of my relevant papers and work in progress.
